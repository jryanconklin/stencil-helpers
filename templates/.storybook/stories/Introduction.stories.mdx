# Welcome to REPLACE Design Storybook

REPLACE Design is the Design System for [REPLACE](REPLACE LINK).

All rules, documentation, and reusable components can be found right here in Storybook!

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context. This makes it
easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as stories to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

All pieces of [REPLACE] Design are built according to Component Driven Interfaces, with heavy influence from Atomic Design.
Check out Design Tokens, such as Colors and Spacing, in the Protons group. Check out functional components in the Atoms,
Molecules, and Organisms groups (make sure you interact with the Controls panel to dynamically change these in the UI).
Finally, check out full site mockups of key pages in the Pages section.
