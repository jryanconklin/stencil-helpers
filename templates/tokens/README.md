# Design Tokens

Design Tokens uses [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to parse tokens (represented as JSON)
into multiple formats.

This directory can be added at the root of a Stencil Project in `/tokens`.

## Usage

To use this code you'll need to configure Style Dictionary.

```
npm install style-dictionary
```

Add to `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"format.tokens": "style-dictionary build --config tokens/style-dictionary.config.json",
```

## JSON Files

The JSON files here can be auto-generated by tools. SVGs, for example, are written from the
[process-svg](../scripts/process-svg.js) script. While a project can optionally write their token files by hand,
consider leveraging Figma plugins to auto-generate these files.
