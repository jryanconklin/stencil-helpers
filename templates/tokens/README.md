# Design Tokens

Design Tokens uses [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to parse tokens (represented as JSON)
into multiple formats.

This directory can be added at the root of a Stencil Project in `/tokens`.

## Usage

To use this code you'll need to configure Style Dictionary.

```
npm i style-dictionary -D
```

Add to `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"format.tokens": "style-dictionary build --config tokens/style-dictionary.config.json",
```

## JSON Files

The JSON files here can be auto-generated by tools. SVGs, for example, are written from the
[process-svg](../scripts/process-svg.js) script. While a project can optionally write their token files by hand,
consider leveraging Figma plugins to auto-generate these files.

## Configuration

### CSS Variables

The default configuration assumes you'll write CSS Custom Properties to `src/assets/css/base/_variables.css`. If your
path changes, the configuration in `style-dictionary.config.js` should be updated.

### Tailwind Config

The default for Tailwind appropriate Tailwind configuration is sent to `dist`. This config assumes utilities will be
configured in the host application. If you want to configure Tailwind for use in Stencil, be aware that tokens are in 
`dist`.
