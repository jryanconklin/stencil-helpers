# Components

These template components use `frog-` as the web components prefix. This is an easy target to find/replace. For ease of
moving, the web components prefix has been removed from filenames. They are not technically required to be valid, but
are easily added back via macOS Finder's replace command. Simply select in finder and batch replace.
